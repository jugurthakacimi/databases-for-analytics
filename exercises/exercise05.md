- Name: Jugurtha Kacimi
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module: 05
- Database Used: `sqlda` (Sample Datasets)
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin or psql)

## Instructions

- Use the **sqlda** database from the "Loading the Sample Datasets" instructions.
- For each SQL task:
  - Include your SQL in a fenced code block
  - Execute it and include a **screenshot** showing the query and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.
- For explanation questions:
  - Write your answer in complete sentences
  - Include a screenshot if requested

## Question 1

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed
to show a **list of years** that emails were sent.

Your results should list years like this (order matters):

```text
year
2011
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
ORDER BY year ASC
```

## Question 2

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to
show the **number of messages sent by year**,
ordered by year (as shown in the prompt).

Output should resemble:

```text
count   year
...
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT COUNT(email_id), EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year ASC
```

## Question 3

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show:

- the **sent date**
- the **opened date**
- the **interval** between the two

Only include emails that contain **both** a sent date and an opened date.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT sent_date, opened_date, opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL AND opened_date IS NOT NULL
```

## Question 4

Using the `sqlda` database,
write the SQL needed to
show emails that contain an **opened date BEFORE the sent date**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT * FROM emails WHERE opened_date < sent_date
```

### Screenshot

## Question 5

Using the `sqlda` database:
there are **over 100 emails**
that contain an opened date **BEFORE** the sent date.

After looking at the data, **why is this the case?**

### Answer

The dates returned are timestamps without timezone. The emails were sent from different timezones, which is why the opened date appears to be before the sent date.

## Question 6

Using the `sqlda` database, explain in your own words what the following code does:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_points AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM customers
    WHERE longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND latitude IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE dealership_points AS (
    SELECT
        dealership_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM dealerships
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_dealership_distance AS (
    SELECT
       customer_id,
       dealership_id,
       c.lng_lat_point <@> d.lng_lat_point AS distance
    FROM customer_points c
    CROSS JOIN dealership_points d
);
```

### Answer

This code creates temporary tables to store geographic points for customers and dealerships, then calculates the distance between each customer and every dealership.

## Question 7

Using the `sqlda` database,
write SQL to display an
**array of salespeople for each dealership**,
sorted by dealership.

For example - dealership 1 is below:

```text
"{""Fidell,Granville"",""Onele,Jereme"",""Sheriff,Lelia"",""McSpirron,Massimiliano"",""Rennick,Nadia"",""Mace,Eveleen"",""Oxteby,Dukie"",""Spong,Marcos"",""Wogden,Quent"",""Duny,Sandye"",""Loraine,Englebert"",""Meere,Ira"",""Gibbens,Cristine"",""Prine,Lyda"",""McCoughan,Sheff"",""Schule,Giselbert"",""McAndie,Eleen"",""Dosedale,Dorie"",""Nafziger,Shay""}"
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT dealership_id, ARRAY_AGG(last_name || ',' || first_name)
FROM salespeople
GROUP BY dealership_id
ORDER BY dealership_id
```

## Question 8

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state** of the dealership
- the **number of salespeople** for the dealership

Sort by **state**.

Reference image:

### SQL

```sql
SELECT d.dealership_id, d.state, COUNT(s.salesperson_id), ARRAY_AGG(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name)
FROM salespeople s join dealerships d ON s.dealership_id = d.dealership_id
GROUP BY d.dealership_id , d.state
ORDER BY d.dealership_id
```

## Question 9

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to convert
the **customers** table to **JSON**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT ROW_TO_JSON(customers) FROM customers
```

## Question 10

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state**
- the **number of salespeople**
- sorted by **state**

Then **convert this result to JSON**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray-1](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray-1.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT ROW_TO_JSON(t) FROM (SELECT d.dealership_id, d.state, COUNT(s.salesperson_id), ARRAY_AGG(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name)
FROM salespeople s join dealerships d ON s.dealership_id = d.dealership_id
GROUP BY d.dealership_id , d.state
ORDER BY d.state) t
```
